A friend of mine asked for an app that counts and sums kms. He wanted a nice, ultra fast, portable and quick solution

I know it is not a perfect js client app but I take my first baby steps to into the web.

The file distance.html contains the primary app with calls to google map api and the map.html contains the code to place markers to a map.

Still have work to do...
